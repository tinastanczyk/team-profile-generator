# Team Profile Generator MIT [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
  ## Description
  This project was motivated by learning how to use node.js and it's packages inquirer and jest. Team Profile Generator was created to dynamically create and index.html file which dynamically creates cards for employees entered in by the user. The index.html file will display the user's team with respective information of each employee by their role. This generator will help managers and/or business owners organize their employee's information so that it is easily accessible. I learned how to utilize tests for test-driven development.
